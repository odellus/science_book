If this works it should update every time I save.

Okay this is badass. I can just use this. The super cool codemirror editor idea is definitely going to get used, but I think this makes sense for right now. So I don't feel blocked and can focus more on content. Yeah I want to spin up my own whtwnd instance and plug in my codemirror, but I have a bunch of other things I want to do and if it's not a myst rendered blog post on my own fork of whtwnd I will just survive. Right now it lives at [odellus.github.io/science_book][science-book].
